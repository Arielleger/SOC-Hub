      "title": "Dynamic role of soil and terrestrial ecosystems in global C cycle",
      "content"	 : "Global Carbon CycleThe global carbon cycle is a balance of fluxes between reservoirs. Currently there is an imbalance as a result of burning fossil fuels sending an enormous amount of CO2 into the atmosphere.  But, only about half of what is sent to the atmosphere accumulates there and the rest is taken into reservoirs, some into the ocean and a lot into terrestrial component – through vegetation and into soils.  Any process that increases the net movement into stable soil pools is a benefit and any process that increases net movement into the atmosphere is a cost.  There is a large range in both pools and fluxes indicating the uncertainty in our understanding of these processes and how to represent them accurately in earth systems models that generate these numbers.LinksIn-LineI’m a reference-style link 1I’m a reference-style link 1Images",
