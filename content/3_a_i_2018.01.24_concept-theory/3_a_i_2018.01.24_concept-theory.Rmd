#Humification as a theory is unsupported

Explain how humication theory is unsupported.

Discuss the emerging understandings in stabilization mechanisms.

#Rethinking the Conceptual Theory of SOM Sequestration

As paradigms have shifted, its important to get away from humification terminology and embrace mechanistic theories and conceptualizations of soil carbon stabilization.

![Figure 3. The soil continum model (SCM) is an attempt to bring together disparate conceptualizations of soil carbon storage, which is an important step forward in soil science as we try to determine the best measurement and modeling techniques to predict SOC changes.

#Moving forward: bringing together theory, measurement, and modeling

Theory, measurement, and modeling need to be thought of as a single process to close the loop of the scientific method and create usable products to not just inform further science, but also provide farmers, land managers, policy makers, and the general public a tool to understand soil carbon.
