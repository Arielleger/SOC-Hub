## What is big data?

!["Static tag cloud visualization (word cloud) of key terms appearing in abstracts of Big Data-related papers." via [De Mauro, Greco, & Grimaldi, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4907823)

As with [many emerging concepts](got another example?) there is no uniform definition of big data, there are however a conceptual overlaps among them. In 2001, [Laney](link to ref section or doi?) identified Volume, Velocity and Variety as important factors of large format (originally termed 3D) data management. The 3 V's, as they became known, have since been extended them. 

"Big data is a term describing the storage and analysis of large and or complex data sets using a series of techniques""

> “Big Data represents the Information assets characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value.”

in [De Mauro et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4907823)



However, most definitions like to use some set of V's [3,4]. Most often:

* Volume: the size of data generated

* Velocity: the speed of data creation

* Variety: the spread of types of data

* Veracity: the uncertainty, error, or other issues the data

#### So, is the [SOC-HUB](outlink) a "big data" prjoect?

The **volume** of data is XXX.

The **velocity** of the data is limited by the speed at which graduate students will be entering templated data into the hub. As the userbase isn't likely to reach that of a social media platform, SOC-HUB data velocity will be low. 

The **variety** 

### Why big data now?
Machines generate data at this point, more than people

How is it different from small data?

A decade ago big data was heralded by some as the [end of theory](https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/) and [displacing the scientific method](find a link about this). Needless to say this was [not recieved well](find a paper about the/a response to Anderson ) by all. 

### Inductive vs deductive approaches

### Data-Driven Investigation
For a long time the scientific method has dictated that study should follow a distinct process to be valid. This has extended even to questioning of the human genome mapping project as being valid science since it was not hypothesis fueled but more so an exploratory data generating process. 

Now however data-driven investigation has begun to lose its stigma; both in the sense of research that generates data of potential use (see 'omics' research review) as well as using data exploration to drive further exploration (as in the case of Xx?)

## Problems in Big Data solutions
####Bias
There is not uniform access to the systems that generate big data, and thus there will almost inevitably be a slant in any analysis performed on the data. This is in part addressed by good understanding of how the data is generated and the steps involved in processing. 

####Privacy

####Correlation over causation?
[Google's Flu rate prediction bungle](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1203) provides an interesting case of how bias, sampling, and other errors come easily into play when generally accepted scientific practice is left by the wayside in preference of the power of correlation.
