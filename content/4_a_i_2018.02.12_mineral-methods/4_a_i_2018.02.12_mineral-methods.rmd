#Common soil minerals and their structures

Soils are largely made up of minerals formed by the weathering of rocks and in terms of geological time are in a constant state of flux.  Different types of rocks are constantly being weathered to different extents, which creates complex and variable soils.  Differences in rock and weathering pathways have subsequently been linked to differences in soil behavior.  Looking at different minerals and mineral fractions allows comparison of the abilities of soil minerals to interact with things like water, nutrients, and organic matter.
