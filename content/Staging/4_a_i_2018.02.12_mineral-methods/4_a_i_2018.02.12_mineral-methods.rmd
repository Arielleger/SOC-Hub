#Soil minerals, their formation, and their structures

Soils are largely made up of minerals formed by the weathering of rocks geological time and are in a constant state of flux.  Different types of rocks are constantly being weathered to different extents, which creates complex and variable soils.  Rocks and their weathering pathways have subsequently been linked to differences in soil behavior.  Looking at different minerals and mineral fractions lets us evaluate how soils interact with many substances like water, nutrients, and organic matter.

Rocks are made up of varying amounts of primary minerals and weather to secondary minerals.  These minerals then have differing activities in the soil, and can change soil processes and properties.

#Selective dissolutions to measure soil minerals

Selective mineral dissolution is used to estimate the abundance of different mineral in a soil.  Different fractions, like organo-metal complexes, can be extracted
