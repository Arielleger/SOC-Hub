# Global Carbon Cycle

 The global carbon cycle is a balance of fluxes between reservoirs. Currently there is an imbalance as a result of burning fossil fuels sending an enormous amount of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.  But, only about half of what is sent to the atmosphere accumulates there and the rest is taken into reservoirs, some into the ocean and a lot into terrestrial component â€“ through vegetation and into soils.  Any process that increases the net movement into stable soil pools is a benefit and any process that increases net movement into the atmosphere is a cost.  There is a large range in both pools and fluxes indicating the uncertainty in our understanding of these processes and how to represent them accurately in earth systems models that generate these numbers.
